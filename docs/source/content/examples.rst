Examples
========

The list below includes a number of SHARPy examples of increasing complexity. The best way to run them is through the Jupyter Notebooks that can be directly downloaded here. Note also that some of these examples may need additional files which would be located in the ``sharpy/docs/source/content/example_notebooks/`` directory and you may need  to replicate the folder structure such that the examples are capable of finding the required files. Additional examples can be found under ``sharpy/tests/''.
