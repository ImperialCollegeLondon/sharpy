SHARPy Solvers
------------------

The available SHARPy solvers are listed below. Attending to SHARPy's modular structure, they can be run
independently so the order in which you desire to run them is important.

The starting point is the PreSharpy loader. It contains the simulation configuration and which solvers are to be run
and in the order that should happen.
