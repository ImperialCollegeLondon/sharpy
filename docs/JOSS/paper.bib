abstract = {This paper investigates the linearization, using perturbation methods, of the structural deformations in the nonlinear flight dynamic response of aircraft with slender, flexible wings. The starting point is the coupling of a displacement-based geometrically nonlinear flexible-body dynamics formulation with a three-dimensional unsteady vortex lattice method. This is followed by a linearization of the structural degrees of freedom, which are assumed to be small in a body-fixed reference frame. The translations and rotations of that reference frame and their time derivatives, which describe the vehicle flight dynamics, can still be arbitrarily large. The resulting system preserves all couplings between rigid and elastic motions and can be projected onto a few vibration modes of the unconstrained aircraft with geometrically nonlinear static deflections at a trim condition. Equally, the unsteady aerodynamics can be approximated on a fixed lattice defined by the deformed static geometry. Numerical studies on a representative highaltitude long-endurance aircraft are presented to illustrate the approach. The results show an improvement compared to those obtained using the mean-axes approximation. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Henrik Hesse, Rafael Palacios, and Joseba Murua.},

As an extension to the solution technique based on the nonlinear finite element developed by the authors, a modal-based approach is discussed in this paper to solve the strain-based nonlinear beam equations. The modal approach is applied to study geometrically nonlinear static and transient problems of constrained and free slender beams, subject to external structural or aero-dynamic excitations. The efficiency of the modal solution is also compared to that of the finite-element approach.},

abstract = {Blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft with high-aspect-ratio wings is an important configu- ration for high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (HALE UAV). Recently, Northrop Grumann created a wind tunnel model under the Air Force's High Lift over Drag Active (HiLDA) Wing program to study the aeroelastic characteristics of blended-wing-body for a potential Sensorcraft concept. This paper presents a study on the coupled aeroelastic / flight dynamics stability and response of a BWB aircraft that is modified from the HiLDA experimental model. An effective method is used to model very flexible BWB vehicles based on a low-order aeroelastic formulation that is capable of capturing the important structural nonlinear effects and couplings with the flight dynamics degrees of freedom. A nonlinear strain-based beam finite element formulation is used. Finite-state unsteady subsonic aerodynamic loads are incorporated to be coupled with all lifting surfaces, including the flexible body. Based on the proposed model, body-freedom flutter is studied, and is compared with the flutter results with all or partial rigid-body degrees of freedom constrained. The applicability of wind tunnel aeroelastic results (where the rigid-body motion is limited) is discussed in view of the free flight conditions (with all 6 rigid-body degrees of freedom). Furthermore, effects of structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities as well as wing bending/torsion rigidity coupling on the stability and gust response are also studied in this paper. I.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the characterization of the response of a very$\backslash$nflexible aircraft in flight. The six-degree-offreedom equations of$\backslash$nmotion of a reference point on the aircraft are coupled with the$\backslash$naeroelastic equations that govern the geometrically nonlinear structural$\backslash$nresponse of the vehicle. A low-order strain-based nonlinear structural$\backslash$nanalysis coupled with unsteady finite state potential-flow aerodynamics$\backslash$nform the basis for the aeroelastic model. The nonlinear beam structural$\backslash$nmodel assumes constant strain over an element in extension, twist,$\backslash$nand in/out-of-plane bending. The geometrically nonlinear structural$\backslash$nformulation, the finite state aerodynamic model, and the nonlinear$\backslash$nrigid-body equations together provide a low-order complete nonlinear$\backslash$naircraft analysis tool. The equations of motion are integrated using$\backslash$nan implicit modified Newmark method. The method incorporates both$\backslash$nfirst- and second-order nonlinear equations without the necessity$\backslash$nof transforming the equations to first order and incorporates a Newton�Raphson$\backslash$nsubiteration scheme at each time step. Using the developed tool,$\backslash$nanalyses and simulations can be conducted that encompass nonlinear$\backslash$nrigid-body, nonlinear rigid-body coupled with linearized structural$\backslash$nsolutions, and full nonlinear rigid-body and structural solutions.$\backslash$nSimulations are presented that highlight the importance of nonlinear$\backslash$nstructural modeling compared with rigid-body and linearized structural$\backslash$nanalyses in a representative high-altitude long-endurance vehicle.$\backslash$nResults show significant differences in the three reference point$\backslash$naxes (pitch, roll, and yaw) not previously captured by linearized$\backslash$nor rigid-body approaches. The simulations using both full and empty$\backslash$nfuel states include level gliding descent, low-pass-filtered square$\backslash$naileron, input rolling/gliding descent, and low-pass square elevator$\backslash$ninput gliding descent. Results are compared for rigid-body, linearized$\backslash$nstructural, and nonlinear structural response.},

abstract = {Abstract The behaviour of spectra and cospectra of turbulence in the surface layer is described within the framework of similarity theory using wind and temperature fluctuation data obtained in the 1968 AFCRL Kansas experiments. With appropriate normalization, the spectra and cospectra are each reduced to a family of curves which spread out according to z/L at low frequencies but converge to a single universal curve in the inertial subrange. The paper compares these results with data obtained by other investigators over both land and water. Spectral constants for velocity and temperature are determined and the variability in the recent estimates of the constants is discussed. The high-frequency behaviour is consistent with local isotropy. In the inertial subrange, where the spectra fall as n−5/3, the cospectra fall faster: uω and ωθ as n−7/3, and uθ, on the average, as n−5/2. The 4/3 ratio between the transverse and longitudinal spectral levels is observed at wavelengths of the order of the height above ground under unstable conditions and at wavelengths of the order of L/10 under stable conditions. This lower isotropic limit is shown to be governed by the combined effects of shear and buoyancy on small-scale eddies.},

  abstract = {The idea of self-sustaining air vehicles that excited engineers in the seventies has nowadays become a reality as proved by several initiatives worldwide. High altitude platforms, or Pseudo-satellites (HAPS), are unmanned vehicles that take advantage of weak stratospheric winds and solar energy to operate without interfering with current commercial aviation and with enough endurance to provide long-term services as satellites do. Target applications are communications, Earth observation, positioning and science among others. This paper reviews the major characteristics of stratospheric flight, where airplanes and airships will compete for best performance. The careful analysis of involved technologies and their trends allow budget models to shed light on the capabilities and limitations of each solution. Aerodynamics and aerostatics, structures and materials, propulsion, energy management, thermal control, flight management and ground infrastructures are the critical elements revisited to assess current status and expected short-term evolutions. Stratospheric airplanes require very light wing loading, which has been demonstrated to be feasible but currently limits their payload mass to few tenths of kilograms. On the other hand, airships need to be large and operationally complex but their potential to hover carrying hundreds of kilograms with reasonable power supply make them true pseudo-satellites with enormous commercial interest. This paper provides useful information on the relative importance of the technology evolutions, as well as on the selection of the proper platform for each application or set of payload requirements. The authors envisage prompt availability of both types of HAPS, aerodynamic and aerostatic, providing unprecedented services.},
